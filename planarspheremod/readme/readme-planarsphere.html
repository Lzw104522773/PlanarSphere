                <h2>Introduction</h2><br>

                <p>
                    This mod is for mature players. There is very limited swearing/sexual innuendo contained herein.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As said by Hlidskialfs "The Planar Sphere mini-mod is worth installing if you're playing a mage, and nicely answers the question of what you're going to do with that huge empty sphere now that you have it.
                    However, if you didn't find the warped humor in the original Planar Sphere mod amusing, it's strongly advised against playing it now. That aspect of it has not been changed at all. If anything, it's worse. Much much worse.
                </p><br>
				<p>
                    After the first apprentices quest has been done you will have one last encounter with Teos (all native in the game) in which the Sphere is attacked by anti-magic fanatics. After undertaking the quest to get rid of the offenders, and reporting back to Teos, the mod begins as Teos returns some days later (seven days later). 
                    If you have already done the normal Planar Sphere quest (or even entered the Sphere) you will have to cheat. Simply type ClueConsole:CreateCreature("psTeos") within the cheatconsole, on the first level of the Planar Sphere and you can start the mod.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    For those who have played PS before, as of v2.5 a fair amount of new content was added and a number of the old quests have been modified.
                    Some of the new content is *somewhat* hard to find. To find a complete list of noteworthy changes check the very bottom of this read me, under the section entitled SPOILERS.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    <strong>If you don't like spoilers but want to know what to expect:
</strong>
                </p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 4%;">
                    <li>There are two stores, one selling mostly spells, one selling all sorts of fun equipment.
</li>
                    <li>There are a number of optional encounters around the city at one point in the game, it *should* be obvious when you should go wandering around, looking for weird stuff.
</li>
                    <li>Talk to all of the people in the PS. Don't bother talking to the apprentices in the main areas though. They generally say the same stuff.
</li>
                    <li>There is a forge that will let you make a variety of items. The forge itself is downstairs in the fire room. (Next to the ice room, there are three dwarfs walking around)
</li>

                    <strong>Waukeen's Promenade - Averners Odd Items</strong>
A New shop. As some of you will notice, many of the items from the shop contained within the PS have been replaced. They have been moved to a NEW shop. This new shop also sells a number of other powerful items. For exorbitant prices.
To find this new shop, go to the bottom left of Waukeens, on top of the Coliseum walls, AFTER killing the Demilich and BEFORE killing the final boss. Speak to the Moose. (yeah, you heard me right) Once you have entered Waukeen's Promenade, the shop will only exist for 7 days before disappearing. This is because the shop sells some very overpowered items. Thus it is only accessible IF you took the main quest and even then, not for very long.

                </p>
				<p>
                    <strong>Temple District - 'ware the Demons!</strong>
A new encounter has been added in the Temple District AFTER you kill the Demilich and BEFORE you kill the final boss. This encounter can be skipped completely if you wish. This encounter contains the longest cutscene ever. (Well, maybe not, but close) And contains a large number of actors are running around at the same time. Plus it has some of my worst/best attempts at humor. I still laugh when watching the scene. Which is probably bad for the rest of you since I have a weird sense of humor. (Lemurs!) Due to the large number of actors, if you have a very low end machine, I'd advise you to skip this encounter.

                </p>
				<p>
                    <strong>Bridge District - Twins? No. Triplets? No. What's next?</strong>
A new encounter has been added in the Bridge District, AFTER you kill the Demilich and BEFORE you kill the final boss. (heard that before?) This encounter can be skipped if you wish. I mainly made it to test some script options. But there is a nice reward if you finish it. Without getting swarmed and destroyed.

                </p>
				<p>
                    <strong>Planar Sphere: Upper Level</strong>
Most of the original quests have been modified. The demons quest has been rewritten slightly. The Examiner mini-quest is unchanged as are the three fed-ex quests, but the Cowled Enforcer quest has been changed slightly. (To find all of these people, talk to everyone in the room where Teos spawns. The demons are in the room where the Guardian Golem spawns)

Also, once you have finished the main quest, your new contact, named Belle, will appear. Talk to her. There are two quests associated with her, one has yet to be completed. And wont be completed until the next version.

                </p>
				<p>
                    <strong>Planar Sphere: Control Room</strong>
A new Quest has been added here. It is started by talking to the Professor on the platform.
Note: As of v2.5 this quest is not complete. Just the intro is available (talking to the Professor). The quest itself will be somewhat long and I decided if I waited to release PS until I had finished this quest, it would never be released.

                </p>
				<p>
                    <strong>Planar Sphere: Weird mushroom room off of Control Room</strong>
For lack of a better name. The area reference is AR0420. This is where Inchantra is hiding if you took the Cowled Enforcer's quest.

                </p>
				<p>
                    <strong>Planar Sphere: Room with weird device off of Control Room</strong>
Check back here after you have finished off the final boss, you might be surprised. :)

                </p>
				<p>
                    <strong>Planar Sphere: Hot/Cold Room where Tolgerias spawns</strong>
The forge now spawns in the fire room. Along with a few dwarfs to tell you what to do.

                <h4>FINAL BATTLE</h4>
<p><strong>This is a rough synopsis of how Mel's script changes for the different difficulty levels. There are a few other minor changes between difficulties that aren't listed.
Also note that the higher the difficulty, the better the reward.</strong></p>

<p>Melanthium's Spells:</p>
<p>Shield Of Oblivion - Grants immunity to ALL spells and ALL weapons for 40 seconds.</p>
<p>Melanthiums Rage - Think GIANT METEORS smashing you to bits. Like dinosaur extinction size meteors.</p>
<p>Rain of Terror - 50 damage to the target. No save, no nothing.</p>

<p>This is a amazing find and for the adventuring mage and one of extreme use. The wave of obliteration spell was last seen being used around 100 years ago. Two nobles of Tethry were fighting over their fathers castle as his will had left its ownership in debate. As so often is the case in contentious circumstances the two nobles were both powerful archmages both having been tutored by their father in the art. This spell was apparently a family heir lomb and a source of great jealousy from other magical households. Needless to say the two nobles desided that the only answer was for a duel. The results were unpleasant to say the least, afterwards it was deduced from the rubble that both magi had released this spell simultaneously, the effects indeed show the power of this spell. One half of the castle was discovered several years later in  pond several miles away although the servants were never found....the mages were both buried in very small coffins. </p>
<p>When the mage completes his incantation of this spell he raises his hands and pushes his palms away from himself. From his hands  a wall of pure uncontrolled magical energy bursts, The magic explodes forth taking every thing in its path with it. Any creature caught within this energy wave will take massive damage from the energies involved and must save versus spell or be literally obliterated by the sheer power of this spell.</p>
<p><I>Effects:</I></p>
<p>All creatures in the path of the spell will take 10d5+20 points of magical damage with no save. They must then save versus spell at -2 or be vapourised by the spell

<p>This immensly powerful spell is shrouded in mystery (proably because only 4 copies of it have ever been discovered). Its abilities are truely immpressive making it possibly the most powerful protective spell availble to the mage however no one knows where the spell originated from, although some sages believe it was created in the days of Myth Drannor. When the final word of the spell is spoken a globe of twisting magical energies springs up around the caster. The magical globe absorbs all energy that strikes it dissipating it into nothingness. The energy that can be absorbed can be either physical or magical in origin and is completly nullified by the sphere. The intensity of energy that the sphere can absorb relies soley on the ability of the mage who cast the spell and as the mage increases in power so does the spell. </p>
<p>At 16th level the spell protects from 1st to 3rd level spells and protects from non magical weapons.    </p>
<p>At 18th level the sphere protects from 1st to 4th level spells and still protects from normal weapons but grants 25% resistance to all physical attacks.</p>

<p>Area of Effect: 30-foot radius x3  </p>
<p>Saving Throw: 1/2 

<p>A fireball is an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it - 1d6 points of damage for each level of experience of the spellcaster (up to a maximum of 10d6). The wizard points his finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). Creatures failing their saving throws each suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half. This is a more powerful version of the fireball spell, when the final word of the invocation is uttered three roaring balls of flame fly forth to strike 3 respective targets.

<p>The Infernal Combustion Enigma is a truely devastating spell although where it gets is power  remains a enigma.

When it  explodes a huge wall of magical flame erupts around the target, the very air is turned into searing flames and almost nothing is capable of withstanding the intensity of the resulting heat. Mages should be careful when using this spell as it can desimate both party and oppostion.</p>

<p>Normally to conjure monsters or undead on a permanent basis requires much preparation and many rituals, this spell however being as powerful as it is allows the mage to summon forth a minion permanently in one easy spell. The spell allows the caster to choose which type of monster to summon even undead can be summoned, there is no limit to the number of creatures that can be summond so a patient mage can easily go about creating a army.</p>

<p>Area of Effect: Huge!</p>
<p>Saving Throw: 1/2 

<p>This is the final spell of the arch lich Nagath. He spent many hundreds of years journeying the multiverse, on his final trip it is believed that he crossed paths with an over god (much like lord Ao) on the astral plane, needless to say the proud archlich challenged the over god. The  arch lich could not have won but as the god banished him to a plane of eternal fire the archlich screamed forth this terrible spell. The god was unharmed but a shock wave of tectonic violence ran through the astral plane killing many of its inhabitants. When invoked this spell conjuers material from upward of 10 different planes spewing forth a maelstrom of incredible volence.  The main power  of this spell lies in that it draws its energy from its targets and the more beings the greater the power of the spell and the greater its area of effect. For each being the area of effect 2d10 of damage is done with no save and 1d10 damage is done although this can be avoided with a save vs spells at -2. So fantastic is the is the sheer power of the spell that all in side the area of effect (if they survive) will be confused for the next 5 rounds.

<p>Duration: Instantaneous </p>
<p>Casting Time: 8</p>
<p>Area of Effect: Special </p>
<p>Saving Throw: none

<p>In some circles of Archmages it is considered rather pathetic to cast a lightning bolt like a weak little mage. So the thunder bolt was developed. while looking to all intensive purposes like a lightning bolt it is however charged a great deal more and capable of doing vast amounts of damage to anything it stikes. Like the lightning bolt the thunder bolt can rebound hence its mass destructive capabilites may also affect the party but there is no doubt an archmage with this spell can level nearly anything that opposes him.</p>
<p><I>Effects:</I> </p>
<p>The thunder bolt shoots forth and deals 10d8 electrical damage to the target although a save can be made versus spell at -2 to only receive 3/4 of the damage. So power is the Thunder bolt that it is also capable of blowing a enemy off their feet and knocking them unconcious.

<p>Prehaps the most unpleasant or prehaps the most satisfying word of power is the power word of burning. Apparently created by a pyromanical mage in the planar city of sigil called ignus.  When uttered the mage points his finger at the target, it is that targets unlucky day for this spell is immensly powerful. As the spell takes hold reality around the target ripples and changes opening a direct portal to the elemental plane of fire. So powerful is this spell that for a instant the target really is on the elemental plane of fire and unless they are resistant to fire or from the elemental of fire there is a good chance they will be vapourised into a cloud of ash by the heat this spell creates.</p>
<p><I>Effects:</I></p>

<p>Saving Throw: see below

<p>When compared to the Tanar'ri, at least the Baatezu are more civilized. There is, perhaps, nothing more horrific than the unbounded fury of Abyss. By use of this spell, the ground shall split open and the victim dragged into the Tanar'rian Madness. Welcome to Hell.

<p>This spell opens a planar portal beneath a specified victim and drags them down into the Abyss. The portal remains open even after the victim is swallowed in. The only sound bystanders hear is the incessant screaming of the victim as he/she is torn apart by the ruthless Tanar'ri. After what seems like only a few seconds (which is more than an eternity for the victim in the Abyss), the victim (or what's left of him) gets spat back out of the portal. </p>
<p>(1) If the victim makes a successful saving throw, he will get spat out of the portal in 'one piece,' but while the victim sensed nothing at first, after a split-second, all the Wrath of the Tanar'ri will surface. The victim will suffer 10d8 pts. of damage as he suffers multiple 'delayed' attacks and slashes from all angles. </p>
<p>(2) If the victim fails the saving throw, it is instant death. All that is left are body parts.

<p>Ajundurar's Ice Shard, a extremely useful spell often employed by powerful mages due to its comparitively short casting time.

<p>Azuth the lord of spells, was once a powerful mortal archmage until he assended unto godhood. Shortly before he became a god it is believed he forged this spell, prehaps his crowning acheivement, even more so then imortality. However soon after his acension this spell was apparently destroyed by Mystra, for its power was to be feared even by the gods. This spell takes a mage a great deal of time to cast, however when it is finally unleased nothing may withstand it. For a single instant it surrounds the target with total nothingness, this nothingness drains magic from the target, severely weakening them. It is prehaps the only way a mage can battle a god for only a spell such as this can make a god vunerable to a mages magic.

<p><I>Effects:</I>

<p>This spell wipes away magical resistances when cast all of the targets resistances will be lowered by 100% all physical and magical protections surronding the caster will also be removed as well as the targets immunity to magic.

<p>Casting time: 8

<p>A effective intra-combat spell for the adventuring mage. When cast reality is seen to warp and twist around the caster and he visibly fades out of existence. In actuality the caster is displaced slightly from the normal stream of time. The effect of this temporal displacement is to make the mage harder to affect from normal reality. Weapons seem not to be able to connect with the mage and any none magical weapon is incapale of affecting the mage. Because the mage no longer exists in the normal flow of events while under the effects of this spell no aging can take place, also speed altering spells and spells that imprision or maze  are useless against the mage. From the mages view the world appears to be moving exceedingly slowly but to others the mage moves extremely quickly becoming a deadly foe.

<p>Immunity to non-magical weapons.</p>
<p>40% resistance to all forms of physical attack.</p>

<p>A particular mage who long frequented the waterdeep region of the realms was a keen fan of magical dueling. In this dangerous sport magical items were bet and two mages would duel till one submitted, the winner taking the items. The mages name was Belfarst, he created a winning stratagee where by he would estimate his opponents ability and then count the number of spells they had cast so that he always had spells when his opponent was out. This method of dueling however failed him when he encountered Melectar. Melectar had long researched what powers allowed a mage to memorise spells. This enchantment was his result, it allowed him to rememorise spells after he had cast them. Although the casting was very difficult Melectar managed to cast it before the duel. Belfarst was horrified to discover that when he still had only a few magic missile spells left, Melectar was till tossing chain lightning. Melectar won, acidentally killing Belfarst with a disintergrate spell. This spell is his legacy to magic though its uses strech far beyond dueling. This spell rememorises one wizard spell of 6th level or lower every turn for the duration of spell. Due to the energies involved there is a small chance that the spell will cause 5d10 damage upon casting, the spell regeneration will still occur though.

<p>Saving Throw: Neg

<p>This spell is generally accompanied by a wave of evil laughter. Apparently this spell was created by a fairy godmother  (who as everyone knows are generally pretty strange people) gone mad. The kitchen maid  had of course just married the prince.  The fairy godmother was casting a spell to allow them to dance in mid air surrounded by music and magical lights. However during the casting, for absolutely no apparent reason the fairy godmother went completely and utterly insane. The spell reflected this sudden change of mental state and the bodies of the maid and prince withered into decayed corpses dancing for all eternity (funelly enough no one really seemed to mind since the marriage was only so the king could fufil a clause in a will allowing him to collect a vast inheritance). Never the less despite the stressful circumstances the court mage managed to copy down the spell as the fairy godmother screamed it. Luckily he had the forsight to copy it onto a fire proof scroll. This was luckily because several seconds later the fairy godmother turned herself into a small purple atomic pumpkin. Several years later when the castle ruins had ceased to glow mauve, an adventuring mage found the scroll and the spell has propigated from that time forth.  This spell causes the targets body to decay into rotting corpse that spasams and jerks as it dances to some obscene infernal music. The target can save versus death at -3 otherwise it will dance forever or until slain. Even if they resist the effect of spell they are still cursed with bad luck for 6 hours.</p>

<p>Tereledra was a powerful archmage who resided on the plane of dust, a plane that sucks the life out of its inhabitants. Tereledra had long travelled the planes and had built up many enemies especially in the anarchist faction of sigil. After being attacked by a group of anarchist wild mages he decided to give it all up, change his name and vanish. For many years he journeyed the inner planes free of his old foes. He joined with a well respected group of mercenaries and travelled with them long, eventually he confieded in them his old and secret identity, feeling he could trust them. Little had he bargined on the size of the anarcists reward for his head. The mercenary group turned on him. They underestimated his power and Tereledra in a fit of rage slew them all consigning their souls to a pocket plane to serve him for all eternity. This spell their only gateway to the rest of the planes. It is believed that Tereledra was later slain when one of the wraith company was resurected by a simpathetic priest, the freed wraith killed Tereledra in a single stroke.  This spell will call forth 5 to 10 wraiths of Tereledra's old mercenary group. The wraiths will serve the caster for 2 hours before returning to their pocket plane. The wraiths are fighters of between 7th and 10th level carrying +1 equipment. The wraiths will serve the caster without question but cannot communicate with anything else. The wraiths will also serve Tereledra before any other so they are incapable of fighting him or in any way inconviniencing him. </p>

                <h3>Installation Order</h3>

                <p style="margin-top:2%;">
                    &#10173; Although it is not required for Mymod to function properly, you are strongly recommended to also download and install the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/files/file/696-bg2-fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Please install Mymod after Divine Remix mod, as it alters spells in Lizard Man Shamans spellbook</li>
                    <li>Please install Mymod after Imoen Romance.</li>
                    <li>...</li>
                </ul><br>

                <p>&#10173; &#9888;&#65039; Don't forget that there are mods managers that strive to make the players life easier. So don't forget to create and fill the <em>mymod.ini</em></a> file in &#x1F4C1; <strong>mymod</strong> folder.
                </p>

                <p>

                </p>

                <p>
                    It is very easy. If your mod must be installed <strong>after</strong> for eg: BG2Fxpack, EET and Divine Remix mods, all you need to do is to fill the following line in mymod.ini, using tp2 name without .tp2 extention:
                </p>

                <div class="important_tuto">
                    <p>
                    <pre># This mod must be installed *after* those ModID listed below, comma-separated list:
After = bg2fixpack, EET, divine_remix</pre>
                    </p>
                </div><br>

                <p>And that's it! Players will NEVER install those mods using bad install order. &#128521;

                <p style="margin-top:2%;">
                    <em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-mymod.exe&nbsp;</span></strong>, un-install all previously installed components and delete the &#x1F4C1; mymod folder.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>When installing or un-installing, <strong>do not close the <acronym title="Console application like Command Prompt, Windows Terminal, macos Terminal, Linux Shell etc">Console</acronym> window</strong> by clicking on the <strong>X</strong> button! Instead, press the <strong>Enter</strong> key whenever instructed to do so.</em>

                <p>
                    <strong>Disable any antivirus</strong> or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly Avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.

                    Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access.

                <p style="margin-top:2%;">
                    The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

                <p>
                    Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify (<em>the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file</em>). On successful extraction, there should be a &#x1F4C1; mymod folder and a setup-mymod.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-mymod.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
                </p>
                <p>

To install, double-click <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-mymod.command&nbsp;</span></strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-mymod.command&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise the components settings.

                    Download the latest Linux version of <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases"><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym></a> and copy weidu, weinstall and tolower to /usr/bin. Then open a terminal and <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;cd&nbsp;</span></strong> to your game installation directory.

                <p>
                    <em>Optional: run 'tolower' and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either, if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    These are some general tips if you have problems getting the game working, with or without this or other mods. Many times, errors have to do with the game engine itself or the manner of installation or gameplay. The game recommends deleting all files out of the /cache, /temp and /tempsave &#x1F4C1; sub-folders in your game folder to see if that resolves the problem before any further troubleshooting.
                </p><br>

                <hr style="width: 90%;" /><br>

                <p>
                    <strong>Symptom: Game freezes or crashes to desktop (CTDs)</strong>
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the game displays an "assertion error" in a pop-up window when this happens, but often times it doesn't. To enable the full error message, open the file <strong>baldur.ini</strong> in your game folder with a text editor (such as Notepad). If you find you can't edit it or save changes in Windows Vista or 7, see <a href="http://forums.bioware.com/viewtopic.html?topic=662080&forum=10">this topic</a> for assistance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under the [Program Options] section in the file, type <strong>Logging On=1</strong> (unless it's already there). While you're there, you may also want to make sure <strong>Debug Mode=1</strong> is there to enable the <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/appendices/clua/bg2.htm">CLUA Console</a> for debugging and testing. Save the file and exit. Now go back into the game and try to reproduce the crash. Then look in your game folder again for the <strong>Baldur.err</strong> file and open it with a text editor to analyse its contents.
                </p><br>

                <hr style="width: 90%;" /><br>

                <p>

                    This usually indicates an animation-related issue. Make sure you have the latest version of the mod. If you've installed other mods after it and have this issue, install the fix available <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/files/file/884-ia-aurora-low-fix/">here</a>.

                    Less-than-informative messages like these may indicate you're installing to a hard drive with a low data transfer rate or an antivirus program is active during installation (which can also affect data transfer). Try installing to an internal drive with antivirus protection disabled during the install. If unsure, disconnect from the Internet (either unplug your network cable or disable your wireless adaptor) and turn off <strong>all</strong> memory-resident programs during the install. To get a list of these, go to Start > Run and type <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;msconfig&nbsp;</span></strong> where it says "<em>Open:</em>" then click OK. When the System Configuration Utility appears, click on the Startup tab. The only really necessary programs that need to be loaded in memory at startup are those related to your graphics chip (typically ATI or NVIDIA). Uncheck everything else, reboot and try installing the mod again. There are well-documented issues with installing mods while Avast antivirus is running, so make absolutely sure all components of Avast are completely disabled.

                    The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going strong for more than 10 years now, and is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding hours by fellow fans of the game. Modders produce their best work and players get the best, well-supported mods when we all work together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else's work as your own. The second is to host and redistribute a mod without permission from the author(s).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be kind to your fellow players and modders. Don't do either.
