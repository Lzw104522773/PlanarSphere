<CENTER><h2 id="1.-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
======================================================</CENTER>

This mod is for mature players. There is very limited swearing/sexual innuendo contained herein.

As said by Hlidskialfs "The Planar Sphere mini-mod is worth installing if you�re playing a mage, and nicely answers the question of what you�re going to do with that huge empty sphere now that you have it."
However, if you didn't find the warped humor in the original Planar Sphere mod amusing, it's strongly advised against playing it now. That aspect of it has not been changed at all. If anything, it's worse. Much much worse.

After the first apprentices quest has been done you will have one last encounter with Teos (all native in the game) in which the Sphere is attacked by anti-magic fanatics. After undertaking the quest to get rid of the offenders, and reporting back to Teos, the mod begins as Teos returns some days later. 
If you have already done the normal Planar Sphere quest (or even entered the Sphere) you will have to cheat. Simply type ClueConsole:CreateCreature("psTeos") within the cheatconsole, on the first level of the Planar Sphere and you can start the mod.


For those who have played PS before, as of v2.5 a fair amount of new content was added and a number of the old quests have been modified.
Some of the new content is *somewhat* hard to find. To find a complete list of noteworthy changes check the very bottom of this read me, under the section entitled SPOILERS.


If you who don't like spoilers but want to know what to expect:

- There are two stores, one selling mostly spells, one selling all sorts of fun equipment.

- There are a number of optional encounters around the city at one point in the game, it *should* be obvious when you should go wandering around, looking for weird stuff.

- Talk to all of the people in the PS. Don't bother talking to the apprentices in the main areas though. They generally say the same stuff.

- There is a forge that will let you make a variety of items. The forge itself is downstairs in the fire room. (Next to the ice room, there are three dwarfs walking around)



<CENTER><h2 id="2.-installation">2. Installation</h2>
======================================================</CENTER>

<strong>BG2EE</strong> or <strong>BGII: Throne of Bhaal</strong> is required. This mod was not built to include the PlanarSphere Return add-on and compatibility issues may arise.


The mod was made Weidu-compatible by Hlidskialf and should install like any other Weidu mod. 

Unzip the main ZIP file into your BGII main directory. This is normally:
        C:\Program Files\Black Isle\BGII - SoA\

Run (click on) "Setup-PlanarSphere.exe" and follow further instructions from there.

To uninstall, run "Setup-PlanarSphere.exe" again and select the uninstall option.  

<strong>EET</strong> : Install this mod <strong>in your BG2EE game AFTER</strong> EET ! 


<CENTER><h2 id="3.-known-bugs">3. Known bugs</h2>
======================================================</CENTER>

Issues with Harper Quest if it's not finished before PS's main quest triggers.
It is advised that you do the Harper Hold piece of Jaheria's romance BEFORE you trigger the main PS quest (The main quest is triggered by returning the Artifact to Teos).

If you use the innate ability "Forge Item" anywhere, the forge will talk to you the moment you enter its sight range, without you having to cast Forge Item again. This annoys me but I can't figure out a way around it at the moment, at least not without re-writing the way it works.

Also, there MAY be conflicts with Beyond The Law. BTL requires that you spend some time in the Government district, it is conceivable that you could be prevented from accessing the government building at a very inopportune time. I haven't checked this for sure, because my BTL game ended up being "Lets fix PS instead of playing!" If anyone does encounter any issues, please let me know.

<CENTER><h2 id="5.-spoilers">5. SPOILERS</h2>
======================================================</CENTER>

<strong>Waukeen's Promenade</strong> - Averners Odd Items
A New shop. As some of you will notice, many of the items from the shop contained within the PS have been replaced. They have been moved to a NEW shop. This new shop also sells a number of other powerful items. For exorbitant prices.
To find this new shop, go to the bottom left of Waukeens, on top of the Coliseum walls, AFTER killing the Demilich and BEFORE killing the final boss. Speak to the Moose. (yeah, you heard me right) Once you have entered Waukeen's Promenade, the shop will only exist for 7 days before disappearing. This is because the shop sells some very overpowered items. Thus it is only accessible IF you took the main quest and even then, not for very long.

<strong>Temple District</strong> - 'ware the Demons!
A new encounter has been added in the Temple District AFTER you kill the Demilich and BEFORE you kill the final boss. This encounter can be skipped completely if you wish. This encounter contains the longest cutscene ever. (Well, maybe not, but close) And contains a large number of actors are running around at the same time. Plus it has some of my worst/best attempts at humor. I still laugh when watching the scene. Which is probably bad for the rest of you since I have a weird sense of humor. (Lemurs!) Due to the large number of actors, if you have a very low end machine, I'd advise you to skip this encounter.

<strong>Bridge District</strong> - Twins? No. Triplets? No. What's next?
A new encounter has been added in the Bridge District, AFTER you kill the Demilich and BEFORE you kill the final boss. (heard that before?) This encounter can be skipped if you wish. I mainly made it to test some script options. But there is a nice reward if you finish it. Without getting swarmed and destroyed.

<strong>Planar Sphere:</strong> Upper Level
Most of the original quests have been modified. The demons quest has been rewritten slightly. The Examiner mini-quest is unchanged as are the three fed-ex quests, but the Cowled Enforcer quest has been changed slightly. (To find all of these people, talk to everyone in the room where Teos spawns. The demons are in the room where the Guardian Golem spawns)

Also, once you have finished the main quest, your new contact, named Belle, will appear. Talk to her. There are two quests associated with her, one has yet to be completed. And wont be completed until the next version.

<strong>Planar Sphere:</strong> Control Room
A new Quest has been added here. It is started by talking to the Professor on the platform.
Note: As of v2.5 this quest is not complete. Just the intro is available (talking to the Professor). The quest itself will be somewhat long and I decided if I waited to release PS until I had finished this quest, it would never be released.

<strong>Planar Sphere:</strong> Weird mushroom room off of Control Room
For lack of a better name. The area reference is AR0420. This is where Inchantra is hiding if you took the Cowled Enforcer's quest.

<strong>Planar Sphere:</strong> Room with weird device off of Control Room
Check back here after you have finished off the final boss, you might be surprised. :)

<strong>Planar Sphere:</strong> Hot/Cold Room where Tolgerias spawns
The forge now spawns in the fire room. Along with a few dwarfs to tell you what to do.
